<p>For the past six months, I've been on an exciting adventure at Open Weaver as a UI/UX Design Intern. Starting with templates for their low-code/no-code platform, Studio, from sleek websites to cutting-edge Gen AI apps, I soon found myself working on diverse client projects. Collaborating with a dedicated team, I mastered the art of creating intuitive and visually stunning user experiences.</p>
<h3>Part of revolutionizing school uniforms</h3>
<p>But wait, let's rewind a bit! Before my time at Open Weaver, I was weaving a different kind of magic at Scribbles, a school uniform manufacturer. For two years, I worked on conceptualizing and refining school uniform designs. Here, I discovered a passion for the intersection of aesthetics and functionality. This role gave me a solid foundation in understanding user needs and preferences. </p>
<h3>A Pause and a Pivot</h3>
<p>Then came a plot twist—my career break for marriage and pregnancy. As a first-time mom, life felt like a whirlwind. Amidst sleepless nights and diaper changes, I discovered my knack for organizing chaos. Keeping baby necessities within reach, arranging my space for efficiency, and finding clever ways to keep my little one engaged—all these everyday challenges turned into a playground for my design skills. This break revealed that design is everywhere, reigniting my passion for creating solutions that make life easier.</p>
